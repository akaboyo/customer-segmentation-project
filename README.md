# [CUSTOMER SEGMENTATION PROJECT WITH R](#customer-segmentation-project-with-r)

## Project Objective
The goal of this analysis is to uncover key insights into customer purchasing behaviors within the chips category, using segmentation based on LIFESTAGE and PREMIUM_CUSTOMER attributes. The insights will provide actionable recommendations to Julia, the Category Manager, as she prepares for the upcoming category review. By identifying high-value customer segments, understanding their preferences, and pinpointing sales drivers, the analysis will inform targeted strategies to optimize product offerings, promotions, and pricing, ultimately driving revenue growth and customer engagement.
